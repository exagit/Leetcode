    Add Expense flow:
       Create graph edges from expense record
       Add edges to graph with EDGE_TYPE = REGULAR
       if(simplifiedEdges == true){
        Clear all simplified edges
        Calculate new simplifies edges 
       }
    Delete Expense flow:
        Create graph edges from expense record
        Remove the above edges from graph with EDGE_TYPE = REGULAR
        if(simplifyDebts == true){
            Clear all simplified edges with EDGE_TYPE = SIMPLIFIED
            Calculate new simplifies edges 
        }

    Get Overall Balance statement:
        For each member:
            Sum all in active edges to get 'total owed'
            sum all out active edges to get 'total owing'
            if(simplifyDebts == true)
                activeedge = EDGE_TYPE.SIMPLIFIED
            else
                activeedge = EDGE_TYPE.REGULAR
